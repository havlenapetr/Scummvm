Notes
=====

- While it's possible to compress certain game resources to reduce their size,
  this can (and usually will) cause games (especially animation) to be choppy
  sometimes, as it ofcourse needs extra CPU power to decode these files.
  As such, it is recommended to play games in their original, uncompressed,
  form whenever possible.

- This README may be outdated, for more up-to-date instructions and notes see

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Q:  What do I need to run the games?
A:  A 1.00 or 1.50 firmware PSP (or an EBOOT loader on firmware 2.00 or
    higher), and the necessary datafiles for the game you want to play and
    obviously this ScummVM port.

Q:  Can I run game X with this?
A:  You can find the list of supported games on the compatibility page
    on http://www.scummvm.org.
    Note that ScummVM is NOT a 'DOS (game) emulator', but written
    specifically for certain games/engines.

Q:  My Monkey Island 1 doesn't have any music, what gives?
A:  If your version of Monkey Island came on a CD then it has the music
    as CD Audio tracks. You need to rip those to MP3/Ogg and copy them
    to the same directory as the game datafiles for music to work.

Q:  Game X crashes, or feature Y doesn't work. Can you fix this?
A:  Possibly.
    Because of the large amount of games ScummVM supports we obviously haven't
    played them all start-to-finish on the PSP, so it's possible there
    are bugs or issues that we're not aware of.
    When you encounter such a bug, please use the "Bug Tracker" you find linked
    on the ScummVM website, and mention all relevant info (i.e. that you're
    using the PSP version, which ScummVM version it is, if the problem exists
    in a recent PC SVN version, a detailed description of the problem,
    and if at all possible a nearby savegame), this will make it much easier
    for us to reproduce (and hopefully fix) the problem.


Building the source code
========================
To build ScummVM for PSP you need:

- PSP toolchain	(svn co svn://svn.pspdev.org/psp/trunk/psptoolchain)

- PSPSDK	(svn co svn://svn.pspdev.org/psp/trunk/pspsdk)
		Note: This usually gets installed by the PSP toolchain,
		so you don't have to do it manually.

- SDL		(svn co svn://svn.pspdev.org/psp/trunk/SDL)

- zlib		(svn co svn://svn.pspdev.org/psp/trunk/zlib)

- libmad(*)	(svn co svn://svn.pspdev.org/psp/trunk/libmad)

- libTremor(*)	(svn co svn://svn.pspdev.org/psp/trunk/libTremor)

(*) = optional

When you've installed these libraries (read their README.PSP for instructions),
type "make" in the backends/platform/psp directory to build a 1.00 firmware
EBOOT.PBP, or "make kxploit" to build the 1.50/kxploit EBOOT.PBPs

You can control most of the build process (engines and libraries used) from
the Makefile.
