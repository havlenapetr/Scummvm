How to save

NOTE: Everything is saved to the SD card, saves are stored in the saves
folder under your main ScummVM executable unless you set another save
location.

The configiration file for ScummVM (.scummvmrc) is stored in the same
place as the ScummVM executable.

The save process below is for Scumm engine games but the principle is
the same for all.

In Game.

1. Menu Button
2. Select SAVE with B
3. Select a position with B
4. Right trigger puts 0 in the name box for some text.
5. Press B to save

Basically the emulated keys you can use are equivelent to the values
buttons are mapped to,
